            <h2>What is YouTube Word Search?</h2>
            <p>YouTube Word Search is a search tool for words used in YouTube videos. This website is ideal for when you're watching a YouTube video and think <b>"When are they going to finally talk about [blank]?"</b> or <b>"I wonder how many times they said the word [blank] in this video."</b><br /><br /> Just enter the URL of any YouTube video with captions and see a list of words said in that video ranked by number of times used. Click on any word to see a breakdown of the phrases it was used in, as well as a link to the exact point in the video where each phrase was spoken.</p>
